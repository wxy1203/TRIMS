(see Fig.1)\n2233H - DTM had advised driver to write in to CAG feedback on the online coupon redemption discrepancy and to settle the payment first in advance but driver initially refused and had contacted APD hotline two more times.\n#### - APD DOR had also advised said driver to write in to CAG feedback channel for an investigation on the matter and to await for a reply upon completion of investigation.\n2251H - Driver relented to settling the payment first and had taken down DTM's name in order to write in backhand for investigation report on the matter to be opened.\n#### - DTM had requested WP to only charge the initial fee of SGD$6.16 in view of the delay and experience that driver had faced throughout the incident.\n#### - The fee was paid by driver via PayNow to Wilson's parking, QR code and an e-receipt was submitted online to driver via email correspondence.\n2255H - All resources (DTM & EO) stood down after driver had left Carpak 2A.\n#CCTV - According to the EO and CCTV footage (#T2A L1WP Exit Camera), the driver parked his vehicle at CP 2A exit gantry lane no. 1 from 2127H before exiting at 2255H rendering 01 out 0f 02 lanes to be closed (see Fig. 2).\n#### - No tailback was observed at exit gantry to Carpark 2A as vehicular movement was minimal at time of incident.\n#### - Based on Wilson Parking's records, the vehicle (SKP 7077T) entered T2 Carpark 2A at 1854H before proceeding to park his vehicle.\n#### - CAG Arrival Team (Atikah) was informed; CAG Changi Rewards Team was also informed as the parking rebates were under CR purview.\n#### - CMC was kept abreast of the incident.\n#### - CITADEL Report R24027560 was submitted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

However, Engie technician (Chinna) was unable to advise on the reason for the disruption.\n - DTM advised the airport staff to use alternative airside staff entrances due to the potential long waiting time.\n\n#### - Queue situation at airside staff entrance: \n0238H - 10 airport staff waiting to enter airside, 10 airport staff waiting to exit.\n\n0253H - At peak, 10 airport staff waiting to enter airside, 15 airport staff waiting to exit.\n\n0248H - An additional APO was also deployed onsite with the first MAU at the staff entrance. However, the MAU started lagging after clearing 2 airport staff hence, a second MAU was activated by Certis Patrol Supervisor to clear the crowd.\n\n0255H - Second MAU arrived onsite and the first airport staff cleared the staff entrance at 0256H, 44 minutes after the holding of first airport staff.\n\n0308H - Third MAU was brought to the staff entrance as a backup.\n\n0310H - Queue was cleared at the staff entrance.\n\n0311H - Certis resumed the use of APCS after noting that it was serviceable. \n\n#### - It was later established that the APCS had not been disrupted since the start of the disruption. However, they were not utilized by the APO due to miscommunicate by the APO (Tiong) and the Patrol Supervisor (Jia Sheng).\n\n0454H - CIOC and FMC updated that all affected equipment (2 Turnstile, X-Ray machine and WTMD) resumed normalcy (approx 2 hours 42 minutes after first observed by APO). \n\n#### \n- Post investigations revealed that the affected equipment all had Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) where the equipment can usually last for approx 1 hour.\n- In this case, the electrical shutdown was scheduled for 4 hours (0100H to 0500H). \n- Additionally, CIOC shared that they were unaware of the power shutdown at the staff entrance, hence they did not cater additional manpower and MAU to support the staff entrance operations.\n- DTM informed CIOC of the similar electrical shutdown happening on 9 Apr 2024 for the same area and requested for Certis to prepare for additional manpower and MAU onsite as contingency.",

Certis APOs also did not observe the errors to be isolated to any specific AIG. \n2308H - SITA shared that the boarding passes that could not be scanned were successfully scanned via Passenger Reconciliation System (PRS) at the Departure Access Control Point (DACP). SITA thus suspected that the fault could be originating from Idemia's systems and alerted them accordingly. \n#### - SITA observed no abnormality with their PC within the AIG. \n\n0023H - Idemia shared that they found no abnormalities with the departure AIGs and were investigating further. \n#### - Idemia technician (Ariffin) shared that he observed an instance of a 5J boarding pass being unable to be scanned at the AIG and was similarly unable to be scanned at the DACP PRS. \n#### - SITA was alerted by Idemia to conduct further checks. \n0037H - Idemia confirmed that there were no abnormalities with the departure AIGs and suspected the cause of the incident to be a boarding pass printing issue. Idemia shared that they would monitor the next 5J departure flight (5J814, STD: 1035H) for further abnormalities with the AIGs. \n0118H - SITA technician updated that testing was done on 5J's Departure Control System (DCS) and boarding pass printing. \n#### - SITA determined that the fault was attributed to a printing error on the affected boarding passes, when its printed using 5J's Skyport DCS. SITA shared that Skyport was 5J's back-up DCS and was not in use. No abnormalities were observed when boarding passes are printed using 5J's current DCS GoNow. \n\n#### - SITA advised 5J's Dnata DM to avoid using Skyport to print boarding passes to avoid further incidents. \n#### - It was observed that the barcode was printed over other 5J labelling when the boarding pass was printed via Skyport. \n0122H - DTM checked with Dnata and they confirmed that the Skyport was in use by 5J service counter during check-in operations at CIR 5. \n#### - The 2 kiosk assistance counters manned at CIR 5 were using GoNow DCS at the time of the incident. \n#### - Dnata shared that as per 5J SOP, they were supposed to use GoNow, however, they had used Skyport at the payment counter as it was observed to be faster to prepare flight documents. \n#### - DTM enquired if Dnata would be reaching out to 5J HQ to amend the boarding pass print formatting for Skyport. \n#### - Dnata shared that they would not be doing so as they were not supposed to use Skyport in the first place. \n#### - No congestion was observed at T4 CIR 5 or departure immigration throughout incident management. \n#### - CAG departure team POC was informed on the incident.
